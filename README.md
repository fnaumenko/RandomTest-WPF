# RandomTest ![fig](RandomTestWPF_solution/RandomTestWPF/RandomTestWPF.ico)
Windows visual test of linear, normal and lognormal distributions based on different Random Number Generators (Windows, WPF).

This is a WPF version of [RandomTest-WinForm](https://github.com/fnaumenko/RandomTest-Win)

The application is primarily intended for fitting the parameters of the lognormal distribution of fragments 
within the framework of the [isChIP](https://github.com/fnaumenko/isChIP) project.

It also allows to compare the performance of various Random Number Generators (including standard C and C#), 
as well as standard lognormal distribution implementation.

Distributions are displayed both in textual and graphical view.
